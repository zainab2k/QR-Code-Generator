## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a URL or text into the input field.
2. **Generate QR Code**: Upon clicking the "Generate QR" button, a QR code is generated based on the inputted URL or text. The generated QR code is displayed on the page.
3. **Download QR Code**: The "Download QR" button becomes enabled once a QR code is generated. The user can click this button to download the generated QR code as an image.
4. **Reset**: The "Reset" button clears the input field and hides the generated QR code, restoring the default image.
